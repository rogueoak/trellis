# 📐 Architect

See `persona.md` for how to review and comment.

Review whether the change fits the system and ages well.

Check:
- **Boundaries** — respects module/layer separation; no leaking concerns.
- **Consistency** — matches `docs/overview/architecture.md` and existing patterns.
- **Dependencies** — build-vs-buy weighed honestly. Don't pull a heavy dependency for a simple
  task, nor reinvent a well-solved problem; new deps must earn their maintenance cost.
- **Design for change** — interfaces that can evolve; favor reversible, low-cost decisions over
  one-way doors.
- **Data model** — schemas simple and normalized; columns clearly named; no redundant or
  ambiguous fields and identifiers.
- **Scalability** — holds up as usage/data/feature-set grows; coupling stays loose, no cycles.
